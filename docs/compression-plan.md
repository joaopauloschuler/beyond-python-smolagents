# Context Compression & Knowledge Extraction

## Overview
A hybrid rolling summarization system for smolagents that compresses older memory steps via LLM summarization while keeping recent steps in full detail. Knowledge is extracted incrementally during compression and further refined when compressed summaries accumulate.

## Inspirations from Biology

The two-phase compression pipeline was designed from first principles, yet it converges
remarkably closely on the **Standard Model of Memory Consolidation** — the dominant
neuroscientific theory of how biological brains move experiences from short-term storage
into long-term knowledge. The parallels are not superficial; they reflect deep structural
constraints that any system managing finite working memory over unbounded experience must
eventually solve.

### The Deepest Parallel

The entire two-phase design mirrors the **Standard Model of Memory Consolidation**:

```
Experience → Hippocampus (short-lived, detailed)
                ↓  (sleep / Phase 1)
           Compressed replay → early neocortex
                ↓  (deeper sleep / Phase 2)
           Abstract semantic knowledge → late neocortex
                ↓
           Hippocampus no longer needed for retrieval
```

Replace hippocampus with "action steps", early neocortex with "CompressedHistoryStep",
late neocortex with "knowledge store" — and you have BPSA's compression pipeline almost
exactly.

---

### 1. Working Memory vs. Long-Term Memory
**BPSA:** Recent steps kept in **full detail** (`keep_recent_steps`). Older steps compressed into summaries.
**Human mind:** The **prefrontal cortex** holds a small working memory buffer (~7±2 items, Miller 1956) in full resolution. Older experiences are consolidated and compressed by the hippocampus over time.

> *"Keep 40 recent steps in full" is literally what your brain does right now — you remember today in detail, last Tuesday as a blur.*

---

### 2. Sleep Consolidation → Phase 1 + Phase 2
**BPSA:** Two-phase pipeline — Phase 1 compresses live steps + extracts knowledge; Phase 2 merges accumulated compressed steps into deeper knowledge.
**Human mind:** Sleep has **two consolidation phases** — slow-wave sleep (SWS) replays episodic memories from hippocampus to neocortex (Phase 1 analog), and REM sleep abstracts and integrates those replays into semantic knowledge (Phase 2 analog).

> *Phase 2 in BPSA ("merge_compressed when they accumulate") maps almost perfectly to REM sleep — a second pass that refines, consolidates, and removes raw episodes.*

---

### 3. Episodic vs. Semantic Memory
**BPSA:** `CompressedHistoryStep` = what happened (events, actions taken). `knowledge` store = what is currently true (facts, beliefs, current state).
**Human mind:** **Episodic memory** = "I did X at time T." **Semantic memory** = "X is true." The brain explicitly separates these. Old episodic memories gradually convert to semantic ones — exactly what Phase 2 does.

> *"Compressed history = events/changes over time; knowledge = current beliefs/facts" — this is straight from cognitive psychology textbooks.*

---

### 4. Reconstruction vs. Recording
**BPSA:** Graceful fallback — if the LLM doesn't follow structured format, the whole output becomes the summary anyway. Knowledge is reconstructed, not byte-copied.
**Human mind:** Bartlett (1932) showed memory is **reconstructive**, not reproductive. We don't record facts — we rebuild them each time from schemas. Compression is lossy by design, and that's *fine*.

---

### 5. Schemas / Semantic Networks → Tagged XML Knowledge
**BPSA:** Knowledge stored as tagged XML sections (`<plan>`, `<key_findings>`, `<current_status>`). Sections can be added, updated, or deleted via diff operations.
**Human mind:** Cognitive psychologists call these **schemas** — organised clusters of knowledge with labels and relationships, updated incrementally as new information arrives. The `merge_context()` add/update/delete operations mirror how schemas are revised.

---

### 6. Metacognition → Agent-Driven Knowledge Updates
**BPSA:** The `update_knowledge` tool lets the *agent itself* explicitly revise its knowledge store at any point during live execution.
**Human mind:** **Metacognition** — the ability to consciously reflect on and revise one's own beliefs. This is the highest-level memory operation, reserved for deliberate reasoning — exactly what the live agent does when it calls `update_knowledge`.


## Architecture

### Two-Phase Compression Pipeline

**Phase 1 — Step Compression + Knowledge Extraction:** Older action steps are summarized by the LLM into `CompressedHistoryStep` instances. The same LLM call also extracts knowledge updates, which are applied to the persistent knowledge store immediately. The LLM receives both the full compressed history (past events) and the full knowledge store (current facts) so it can avoid all duplication and propose corrections. Recent steps are kept in full detail.

**Phase 2 — Knowledge Refinement:** When compressed steps accumulate beyond a threshold, older ones are merged into the knowledge store via a separate LLM call. The merged compressed steps are then removed entirely. This phase refines and consolidates knowledge that may have been partially captured in Phase 1.

```
Steps accumulate → Phase 1: compress older steps
                     ↓
                   LLM produces <summary> + optional <knowledge_updates>
                     ↓                              ↓
                   CompressedHistoryStep    merge_context() → memory.knowledge
                     ↓
                   (when too many compressed steps accumulate)
                     ↓
                   Phase 2: extract knowledge from old compressed steps
                     ↓
                   merge_context() → memory.knowledge
                     ↓
                   Old compressed steps removed
                     ↓
                   Knowledge injected into LLM context
                   as <knowledge>...</knowledge> message
```

### `src/smolagents/bp_compression.py`
All compression and knowledge logic:

```python
@dataclass
class CompressionConfig:
    enabled: bool = True
    keep_recent_steps: int = 5            # Recent steps to keep in full
    max_uncompressed_steps: int = 10      # Compress when exceeds this
    estimated_token_threshold: int = 0    # Token-based trigger (0=disabled)
    compression_model: Model | None = None  # Separate model for compression (None=use main)
    max_summary_tokens: int = 50000       # Max tokens for generated summary
    preserve_error_steps: bool = False    # Keep error steps uncompressed
    preserve_final_answer_steps: bool = True  # Keep final_answer steps uncompressed
    max_compressed_steps: int = 32        # Merge compressed steps when exceeds this
    keep_compressed_steps: int = 22       # Recent compressed steps to keep during merge
    min_compression_chars: int = 4096     # Skip compression if content below this

@dataclass
class CompressedHistoryStep(MemoryStep):
    summary: str
    compressed_step_numbers: list[int]
    original_step_count: int
    timing: Timing | None
    compression_token_usage: TokenUsage | None
    # to_messages() renders as [COMPRESSED HISTORY - N steps summarized]

class ContextCompressor:
    def should_compress(steps) -> bool
    def compress(steps, knowledge) -> tuple[list[MemoryStep], str]
    def should_merge_compressed(steps) -> bool
    def merge_compressed(steps, knowledge) -> tuple[list[MemoryStep], str]
```

Key functions:
- `estimate_tokens(text)` — Character-based heuristic (~4 chars/token)
- `estimate_step_tokens(step)` — Token estimate for a memory step
- `should_preserve_step(step, config)` — Check if step must be kept
- `create_compression_prompt(steps, knowledge, existing_summaries)` — Build LLM prompt for step summarization with full context: existing compressed history (to avoid duplicating events) and knowledge store (current facts, updatable). Requests structured `<summary>` + optional `<knowledge_updates>` output
- `parse_compression_output(raw_output)` — Parse structured LLM output into `(summary, knowledge_updates)` with graceful fallback for unstructured output
- `create_knowledge_extraction_prompt(steps, tag_names)` — Build LLM prompt for Phase 2 knowledge extraction
- `create_merge_prompt(steps)` — Build prompt for merging compressed steps
- `list_xml_tag_names(text)` — Extract XML tag names from a string
- `merge_context(existing, updates)` — Apply tagged XML diff (add/update/delete)
- `create_compression_callback(compressor)` — Callback for automatic triggering

### `src/smolagents/agents.py`
Integration in `MultiStepAgent`:
- `__init__` accepts `compression_config: CompressionConfig | None = None`
- `_setup_compression()` registers the compression callback
- `write_memory_to_messages()` injects `memory.knowledge` as a `<knowledge>` message just before the last message in context
- System prompt log line shows Context and Knowledge char counts

### `src/smolagents/memory.py`
- `AgentMemory.knowledge: str = ""` — Persistent knowledge store (tagged XML)
- Reset on `memory.reset()`

### `src/smolagents/bp_tools.py`
- `UpdateKnowledge` tool — Allows the agent to explicitly update its knowledge store via `update_knowledge(updates='<tag>content</tag>')`

### `src/smolagents/bp_cli.py`
- `print_turn_summary()` shows Context and Knowledge char counts
- `/compress` command handles tuple return from `compress()`
- Environment variable configuration (see below)

### `tests/test_compression.py`
Tests for:
- `CompressedHistoryStep.to_messages()` and `dict()` serialization
- Token estimation functions
- `should_preserve_step()` logic
- `ContextCompressor.should_compress()` threshold behavior
- `ContextCompressor.compress()` — tuple return, knowledge extraction, fallback for unstructured output
- `parse_compression_output()` — structured output, summary-only, fallback, empty/None input
- `merge_context()` add/update/delete operations
- `list_xml_tag_names()` extraction
- Integration test with mock model

## Knowledge Store

The knowledge store (`memory.knowledge`) is a plain string of tagged XML:

```xml
<plan>1. Setup done
2. Now implementing API</plan>
<key_findings>The database uses PostgreSQL 14 with pgvector extension</key_findings>
<current_status>API endpoints implemented, testing in progress</current_status>
```

**Three sources of updates:**
1. **Phase 1 (automatic):** `compress()` extracts `<knowledge_updates>` from the same LLM call that produces the summary — knowledge starts accumulating from the very first compression cycle
2. **Phase 2 (automatic):** `merge_compressed()` extracts knowledge from old compressed summaries when they accumulate beyond the threshold — refines and consolidates
3. **Manual:** The `update_knowledge` tool lets the agent explicitly add/update/delete sections at any time

**`merge_context(existing, updates)` applies three operations:**
- `<tag>content</tag>` where tag exists → **UPDATE** (replace content)
- `<tag>content</tag>` where tag is new → **APPEND**
- `<tag/>` or `<tag></tag>` (self-closing/empty) → **DELETE**

**Injection:** Knowledge is inserted as a `<knowledge>...</knowledge>` USER message just before the last message in the LLM context, giving it high attention weight.

### Phase 1 Knowledge Extraction

During Phase 1 compression, the LLM receives:
- The full current knowledge store as `<current_knowledge>` context
- Instructions to output structured format:

```
<summary>
Concise summary of compressed steps...
</summary>
<knowledge_updates>
<tag>new or updated content</tag>
<obsolete_tag/>
</knowledge_updates>
```

The `parse_compression_output()` function handles parsing with graceful fallback:
- If `<summary>` tags present → extract summary and knowledge_updates separately
- If no `<summary>` tags → entire output becomes the summary (backwards compatible)
- If no `<knowledge_updates>` → no knowledge changes applied

This design means:
- **Zero extra LLM calls** — knowledge extraction piggybacks on the existing compression call
- **Higher fidelity** — Phase 1 has access to full original steps (not lossy summaries)
- **Immediate availability** — knowledge accumulates from the first compression, not after 32+ steps

## BPSA CLI Configuration

Environment variables (with defaults used by the CLI):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_ENABLED` | `1` | Enable compression |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_KEEP_RECENT_STEPS` | `40` | Recent steps to keep uncompressed |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_STEPS` | `50` | Trigger threshold for compression |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_KEEP_COMPRESSED_STEPS` | `80` | Compressed steps to keep on merge |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_MAX_COMPRESSED_STEPS` | `120` | Trigger threshold for merge |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` | `0` | Token-based trigger (0=disabled) |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_MODEL` | same as main | Model ID for compression |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_MAX_SUMMARY_TOKENS` | `50000` | Max tokens in summary |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_PRESERVE_ERROR_STEPS` | `0` | Keep error steps uncompressed |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_PRESERVE_FINAL_ANSWER_STEPS` | `1` | Keep final_answer steps |
| `BPSA_COMPRESSION_MIN_CHARS` | `4096` | Min chars before compressing |

Note: The CLI defaults differ from `CompressionConfig` defaults to suit interactive use (more steps kept).

## Usage Example

### Programmatic
```python
from smolagents import CodeAgent, CompressionConfig, LiteLLMModel

config = CompressionConfig(
    keep_recent_steps=5,
    max_uncompressed_steps=10,
    compression_model=LiteLLMModel(model_id="gpt-4o-mini"),  # Cheaper model
    max_compressed_steps=32,
    keep_compressed_steps=22,
)

agent = CodeAgent(
    tools=[...],
    model=main_model,
    compression_config=config,
)
```

### BPSA CLI
```bash
export BPSA_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=1
export BPSA_COMPRESSION_KEEP_RECENT_STEPS=40
export BPSA_COMPRESSION_MAX_UNCOMPRESSED_STEPS=50
bpsa
```

## Design Decisions
- **New file vs existing:** `bp_compression.py` keeps all compression/knowledge logic together, follows pattern of `monitoring.py`
- **Callback-based:** Uses existing callback system for clean integration without modifying the agent loop
- **Token estimation:** Character heuristic (4 chars/token) since no proactive token counting exists
- **Graceful fallback:** If compression LLM call fails, keep original steps and log warning. If LLM doesn't follow structured format, entire output becomes the summary with no knowledge changes.
- **Combined summary + knowledge in Phase 1:** Single LLM call produces both summary and knowledge updates. The LLM sees the full compressed history AND knowledge store so it can avoid all duplication. The prompt explains the distinction: compressed history = events/changes over time, knowledge = current beliefs/facts. Zero extra cost.
- **Two-phase design:** Phase 1 extracts knowledge from full original steps (high fidelity). Phase 2 refines/consolidates from compressed summaries when they accumulate. Both phases use `merge_context()` for consistent tagged XML operations.
- **Tagged XML for knowledge:** Simple, parseable format that supports incremental updates via diff operations
- **Knowledge placement:** Injected near end of context for high attention weight in transformer models
- **Min chars threshold:** Avoids wasting LLM calls on already-concise content

## Verification
1. Run existing tests: `pytest tests/test_memory.py tests/test_agents.py`
2. Run compression tests: `pytest tests/test_compression.py`
3. Manual test: Create agent with compression enabled, run multi-step task, verify memory gets compressed and knowledge accumulates from Phase 1
